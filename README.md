# SQL_product_project

In this project, I will be working with a delivery service that has recently entered the market. Orders can be placed through the app or the web version.

I plan to calculate all the necessary metrics, create charts and dashboards based on them, and generate insights to improve the serviceâ€™s efficiency.

Letâ€™s take a look at the data we will be working with. We have a relational database:

**Structure and contents of the tables:**

**user_actions** â€” user interactions with orders.
