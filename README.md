# SQL_product_project

In this project, I will be working with a delivery service that has recently entered the market. Orders can be placed through the app or the web version.

I plan to calculate all the necessary metrics, create charts and dashboards based on them, and generate insights to improve the service’s efficiency.

Let’s take a look at the data we will be working with. We have a relational database:

![Relation_table](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1777fcf4-8c76-4c6a-95f8-5b6cd6cdc9cd)

*Structure and contents of the tables:*

*user_actions* — user interactions with orders.

*courier_actions* — courier interactions with orders.

*orders* — information about orders.

*users* — information about users.

*couriers* — information about couriers.

*products* — information about the products delivered by the service.
